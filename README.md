## Instructions
Utility Data Viewer

Besides being good for the planet, solar power can help people save money on their utility bills.

Create a stand-alone ReactJS single page application with a Node.JS backend to load the attached JSON file containing utility bill data. The react front end should load the data from the server, and the server should parse the JSON.

When the application is started, one should be able to view in a web browser an app that displays a time series graphical visualization of the utility data.  Include at least two pages demonstrating page navigation and at least two graphs. Please also bear in mind the UI design.

## Summary 
This project is a very simple full-stack application that parses a JSON file that contains utility bill data and utilizes this data to construct graphical representations.

The frontend component was constructed with React. The server side was built in node using the express library.


## Contributions
I am fairly familiar with react but still quite new to node. Therefore I used several youtube videos as tools for creating my this application. The main three were:

A sincere thank you to the aforementioned video producers, who made this project much more conquerable..
