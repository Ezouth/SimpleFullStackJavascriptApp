# Tyler Whidden React & Node Demonstration

This project is a very simple full-stack application that parses a JSON file that contains utility bill data and utilizes this data to construct graphical representations.

The frontend component was constructed with React. The server side was built in node using the express library.

A sincere thank you to the aforementioned video producers, who made this project much more conquerable.
